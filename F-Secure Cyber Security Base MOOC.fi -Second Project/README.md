# Tries to set up Metasploitable 3.

With Project TWO ( https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/project2/ ) we have to install vulnerable system (Metasploitable 3).

And expected option - do this by VM (as example - VirtualBox);
    
    I have uninstalled VirtualBox some time before (based on a lot of crashes and troubles);
    And re-place it with VMWare Player.

Under the Metasploitable3 wiki-page available instruction-steps and requirements.

    System Requirements:
    ====================
    # OS capable of running all of the required applications listed below
    # VT-x/AMD-V Supported Processor recommended
    # 65 GB Available space on drive
    # 4.5 GB RAM
    
    Requirements:
    =============
    # Packer
    # Vagrant
    # Vagrant Reload Plugin
    # VirtualBox
    # Internet connection
    
For me it means that there is small options to launch current VM (not enough powerful Linux machine and not possible under the VM machine).

#FIRST TRY
So I decided to do this by common steps with one of Windows machine (around normal settings).

Also I found that under the metasploitable3-folder we can to use .json-file for VMWare.

I did the try to use it.

Installation of Packer quite normal and brief-step (also added this to system PATH).

Vagrant installation also quickly and added to system PATH by installation-steps. 

Reload plugin also normally installed by documentation-steps.

So brief-try to use it for the VMWare Player shows mistakes (not supported VMWare Player).

But it was possible to fix about some of troubles (add some folders to the PATH and get the VMWare VIX and some of plugins/addon-files).

All of this resources available from VMWare website/kb-pages. And under the Vagrant documentation (as plugin for VMWare).

This steps mainly required just for trying use Vagrant for the VMWare Player. And workaround was around proper view.

But based on other "limitation" (I thought that license-ask about VMWare) - I decided try VMWare Workstation Pro (trial-time) - if it will be more good and work from first.

With VMWare Workstation PRO (trial-time) and .json-file (metasploitable3) for VMWare --> also with Packer/Vagrant usage - there is quite good result (potentially).

But I found that "license-ask" (when we will try to add Vagrant box to the VM) about certain Vagrant design.

If we want to use Vagrant and VMWare (supproted VMWare Workstation) - we have to buy license "Vagrant VMWare".

Maybe it OK, but during my try - their "shop" was not available anyway. Payments methods not visible and just missing.

So - I remove VMWare (uninstall vagrant plugin for vmware-workstation also). And start try next option-step.

<strong>Main meanings about this try can be like that:</strong>

--> If you have (or able to buy) Vagrant VMWare license (different with just VMWare license);

--> And you have license for the VMWare Workstation (or maybe officially supported some other solutions);

       or optionally able to do some of workarounds for VMWare Player with not expected result.
       
<strong>Most likely you normally able to use Packer/Vagrant/Metasploitable3/VMWare setting.</strong>

 <h3><strong>SECOND TRY</strong></h3>
 
 I installed VirtualBox (latest build).
 
 And with already installed/configured (before this) Packer/Vagrant:
 
 I did the try to use packer build for the related metasploitable3 .json-file.
 
 As result : stuck for SSH-waiting.
 
     ==> virtalbox-iso: waiting for SSH to become available...
     
 After some time (hours maybe) time-out comes and break-the-process.
 
 This step also take some delay with my VMWare experience, but anyway normally work.
 
 So, I decided to re-run this for Virtualbox else one time. But the same result after hours.
 
 Basically there was resource-usage, but after that "not" and just stuck for SSH-waiting.
 
 Some thought and else one run - anyway stuck.
 
 I decided to re-check situation with editing .json-file;
 
 I re-change headless-option for VirtualBox running from default-configuration to:
 
      "headless": false
      
 And with my experience - looks like that there is waiting for boot up (just two minutes) not enough.
 
 At least - when command line already noted waiting for SSH to become available (shortly after the waiting for boot up):
 
 There is still installation process about first of steps.
 
 When installation comes and scripts launched under the VM-command line there was visible:
 
 that with try to do something about SSH - there comes a lot of mistakes as output. 
 
 Not check it more - because decided to try add more "boot-time waiting" and check the result else one time.
 
 What if the "ssh"-scripts launched with time, when it not expected and not work "re-launch it" with proper time.
 
 So... I added some time for the "boot up waiting"-option (seven minutes).
 
 Which probably not really related with my situation. There is anyway was delay between this commands.
 
 And most likely "ssh"-scripts launched anyway (like "re-launch" work - if the boot there with delay).
 
 System launched and there is anyway was a lot of mistakes with ssh-cmd-line action (not sure what it was there).
 
 I decided to check more with system "UI". Re-check Firewall rules, re-check folders.
 
 There was missing SSH-clients (OpenSSH under the folders). I decided that maybe it should be there.
 
 Mainly because there was Firewall rules for this.
 
 Go to the VM's browser, Google and type OpenSSH (I not really friendly with ssh).
 
      also there was troubles with opening some HTTPS pages.
      metasploitable3 about outdated build of Windows.
      and there looks like Internet Explorer 8 (or around this).
      
      So I start think at this step.. that maybe there is trouble about it.
      If websites/changes for the HTTPS-setting goes be with broken work for this system already.
      And some scripts-download/get OpenSSH or other requirements not work.
      
 Found also that OpenSSH website not about Windows platform mainly.
 
 And for the Windows usage there is should be available next URLs (and packages there):
 
     https://www.mls-software.com

Also get notifiation about "page not available to open" (based on HTTPS).

Re-change protocol to HTTP and get the block page by F-Secure. :)

    I have to add that my main system (where I try to set up metasploitable3) with F-Secure SAFE installation.
    
    F-Secure SAFE - F-Secure security solution for home users. With mainly two modules AV and Browsing Protection.
    
    Browsing Protection not about just blocking harmful pages and suspicious-rated pages.
    
    But also there some of features like Content Blocker (mainly as Parental Control feature).
    
    I have use Content Blocker for "restrict" access to "unknown-content" pages. 
    
    As result F-Secure installation will be block all pages, which unrated by F-Secure yet.
    
    
And this mls-software page certainly this unrated page by F-Secure (on current time/day).

Funny point that F-Secure installed under my main system, but also will block (restrict access) under VM's system/browser.

Maybe good.

So it was already more visible that maybe it can be reason for SSH-stuck (downloading openssh just not started as example).

I turn off Content Blocker feature. And run next try packer build.

Yes, SSH normally started and all next process goes be with good view.

BUT.... result comes with some of fresh stuck-points (already two times) and as result:

    ==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created.
    
So I have to try some check-dreams about situation..... and understand what can be stuck-reason with this time.

Lines about potential troubles with not visible reasons yet (for me). 
 
Fresh stuck was about next strings-result:

    ==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
    --> virtualbox-iso: Error removing floppy controller: VBoxManage error: 
    VBoxManage.exe: error: The machine 'packer-virtualbox-iso' is already locked for a session (or being unlocked)
    VBoxManage.exe: error: Details: code VBOX_E_INVALID_OBJECT_STATE (0x80bb0007), 
    component MachineWrap, interface IMachine, callee IUnknownVBoxManage.exe: error: 
    Context: "LockMachine(a->session, LockType_Write)" at line 1038 of file VBoxManageStorageController.cpp
    
Firstly I tried to search about this lines.

As result I get view that a lot of people get time to time this troublepoint.

And practically each situation with not visible fix (there potentially some workarounds for them).

I start to think that maybe my situation about something else (because some points differently to the situations).

Also worst points of situation:

    that usually about troublepoints with Packer/Vagrant (?) - there tries to say that trouble with Windows.
    but most of users noted that situation and troublepoints do not related with Windows at all.
    At least for common view of this.
 
So - I decided to check if just "restart" for my main system will be enough.

I just thought - what if my a lot of tries to do "packer build" get the stuck for VirtualBox or other things.

I did the restart. I re-run packer build and it normally completed.

Also I normally add "box" to vagrant.

Next step is "vagrant up"..

With some of check-steps vagrant up normally started, but stable-stuck with trouble result about next point.

    http://sourceforge.mirrorservice.org/w/wa/wampserver/WampServer 2/WampServer 2.2/wampserver2.2d-x64.exe
     
In somewhat reason this URL will return "Page not found" (this URL under the scripts).

As result "vagrant up" do not able complete process normally. Wampserver not installed.

Will try next points.

So - I not sure - why this URL troublepoint with my experience.

Looks like that it stable give the "Page Not Found" with some of my tries (and checks).

So it should be known - but I not found something about it (briefly).

Decided just did the changes for the "metasploitable3\scripts\installs" about install_wamp.bat


    Re-change this trouble-URL:
    -> http://sourceforge.mirrorservice.org/w/wa/wampserver/WampServer 2/WampServer 2.2/wampserver2.2d-x64.exe
    to the next URL: 
    -> https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/wampserver/WampServer 2/WampServer 2.2/wampserver2.2d-x64.exe
    under the related string-line of .bat-file

Re-check with fresh "vagrant up" and all normally downloaded/installed (at least - this step already not a stuck-point);

---> Probably process is completed and looks like that I have to try launch VirtualBox.

But with my first experience there was maybe known trouble about VirtualBOx VMs;

I can to think about some of tries - most likely most of them can be helpful.

With my experience there was enough just restart my main system.

After this - I normally launch VirtualBox VM. 

Some configure-steps for system and I tried to download Snort with their rules.

And get total stuck about this step (but mainly with downloading rules). It was not available.

With next day - I randomly met notification that probably during certain time there was troubles with Amazon S3.

Most likely (and looks like) this trouble was about time when I tried get Snort-rules.

And snort-rules certainly about s3.amazon-URLs, which was not available.

I tried download rules today -> all OK, good and normal. So most likely it was related with this "trouble".

    This situation (with amazon-s3) under articles marked as critical and large trouble.
    But with my experience - I totally do not feel it. 
    I just randomly get trouble-stuck with downloading Snort-rules.
    BUT ALSO MAYBE with uploading files to the github.com; I tried two picture-files.
    It was stable with "trouble"-result. Today - all OK with related steps.
    
    And this experience was more random, that common for my usage. 
    So it was large trouble, but not so critical.

Just anyway good to use such things with reasonable points and with places, where indeed it required too much.
<hr />

Most likely "set up" completed. So will play with Snort.

# SNORT

Firstly tried to understand how to properly use Snort and which result there should be.

Decided to set up it as third "option" : Network Intrusion Detection System Mode ;

With this step (NIDS-try) I get trouble-stuck about configuration.

On current time about next one:

    ... Missing/incorrect dynamic engine lib specifier. Fatal Error, Quitting ...

Some tries, some search with web... but result anyway about this stuck.

Will play with Snort more.... 

stuck mainly was about "uncomment" for the "outdated" rules together with updated-rules.

But I re-check/re-fix and add some else changes to snort.conf (I mean - not just expected ones).

Launch snort and maybe it normally work as IDS; logs also there.

But I have to re-check about certain settings/set-up for good result of Snort-work.

So before experience with metasploit - I have to "play" with Snort more time.

Still not sure that snort configured with enough view/setting and that there is expected set-up.

After some days - I configured Snort maybe with "OK"-view.. 

But with my try to scan ports (and get information about results) - Snort ignore it (or some kind of);

Randomly before my next steps (properly work with Snort and first experience about Metasploit):

I get a little be more, than one week delay.... 

And just with current day I will start to think about continues about this.

Will try to check more about Metasploit and Snort possibilities.

And..... anyway later was else one week delay.

But because there was extending action for course-project-two - so some days it my delay already about two weeks.

Today I get proper time and ability to continue work.

But found that I not able to download Metasploit....... So will play else one time... with this on current time.

After some tricks and tweaks looks like that I able normally use Metasploit.

So, if SNORT will be able to detect such things (which most likely required some else steps :( and configuration):

I just already able to start trying to play with Metasploit more time.

Will be interesting.... but it already take so many time about steps, which (maybe) should be done more briefly.
