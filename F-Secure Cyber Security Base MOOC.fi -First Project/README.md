Small background:
-----------------

This is more like "template" (or PoC), than "application" in fact.

    Design based on my too much small experience with all of this "development"-things;

Also I not really friendly with development.

So I decided to do not hard designed application and with some kind of "tricks" (as can be just like template-PoC);

-------

Project available at the github page: https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse

--> and <a href="https://github.com/marrbjorn/documentation/tree/master/F-Secure%20Cyber%20Security%20Base%20MOOC.fi%20-First%20Project">this page</a> will be as documentation of project;


Setup:
======
Get started can be with next steps:
-----------------------------------

<b>FIRST</b>: we have to be able work with https://cybersecuritybase.github.io (which means proper configured IDE and other requirements);

<br />
<strong>SECOND</strong>: download this project ( https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse ) as zip-file or by git-commands as usually.

<br />
<b>THIRD</b>: unpack it (if downloaded zip-file) and open project under the IDE (with Netbeans: "File -> Open Project..." under the menu).
   
    Then do the "Clean and Build Project" (how it called under the Netbeans);
    this will trigger downloading/creating target-files and properly build project;

<br />
<strong>FOURTH</strong>: "Run" application, when required work or required to do some steps with application.

    first launch may ask about main class - choose this default one.

DESIGN OF APPLICATION
=====================
=====================

There is some kind of landing page for music-party/meeting (but mainly friendly service for music bands);

Each music band/musician already registered to be part of this party (by design);

Service <ins>do not</ins> provide ability to add more bands (this is can be covered by the other one steps);

Service <ins>do</ins> provide own access for each music-band/musician to be with ability "invite listeners";

Like "friend" or someone else (some kind of special listeners); 

As result there will be list (database with "name" and "phone-number") of listeners, which invited by music-bands;

Service provide ability to see full list of this listeneres.

    but this is should be available just for adminstrators (of party/service/website);
    
<hr />

There is practically missing any other features or design at work.
And for critical attacks or total impact there is not so many steps.

      but this is do not remove points that:
        -> "vulnerable" things and 
        -> "vulnerable" design of things
      will add vulnerabilities or troubles to application. 
       and this is:
        -> can be "exploited" or 
        -> not (but with potential ability do that).

<strong>This project will be with improve design and additional features later.
But main meanings will be with same design.</strong>

There is some of steps to play with application-project (for get view of potential troubles or exploiting it);

Under the Java-files (or html-templates) I also added comments about places, which can be fixed (or how can be fixed);

This is mostly covered some of "troubles" in design; But some of them based on "meanings";

<hr />

HOW TO WORK
===========
First steps as start can be like that:
<pre>
When we run application under the IDE - we able to open it under the browser;
By <strong>default</strong> configuration: available at http://127.0.0.1:8080 
</pre>
<hr />
We will be with default login-page. 

For access to service - we have to be authorized;

This is available to do by music-bands' credentials or by admin-access; 
<pre>
At this step - if credentials do not known for us - we able to do some of steps for get access:
 -> Fuzz the login forms (if there is not strong passwords/logins);
 --> Fuzz URL-address (if there can be other pages, than login-page or which do not covered by login-page);
 ---> Found something else.
 
 with this kind of project-application - any of this steps will be valid or helpful.
 Or can be additional potential steps (if "credentials" known already).
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Tools like Burp or OWASP ZAP able to provide ability to configure fuzz-attack for both of meanings.</li>

<li>"Other" steps can be with direct attack or knowledge about this service/administrators.</li>

<li>Additional steps covered by situation - if there is "one of registered accounts" do something "malicious".</li>
</ul>

<hr />

We able to start from trying to find another available pages, than login-form.

This is can be "forgotten debug-pages", "consoles", "backdoors" or other.

Usually this is based on misconfiguration or temporary mistakes;
<pre>
With proper result we able to get "/hidden" page, which looks like development-debug page.
Mainly as temporary ToDo List at the time, when website was maintaining before release;

This page was as "exclusion" for temporary-access (by antMatchers.permitAll).
As usage Java Spring security config feature http.authorizeRequests().
And "excluded" from login-form.

With this kind of project-application it possible:
-> by mistake (as additional to css-access with not proper design);
-> or specially for "debug", but do not removed after the release;

So page available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/hidden

</pre>
<b><sub>Mainly this page have css-style-work, which maybe can to create temporary freeze (sorry - if it will be like that);
this is based on some of CSS-tutorials on web.</sub></b>

Hidden-page directly have meanings that should be available just for administrators (or service) team.

And this is looks like ToDo-list with entry-strings about some of things. 

Page in somewhat reason do not removed or (denied) after temporary-access-debug-time.


With this page we able to get more interesting (or helpful) information:
<ul>
<li>There is note "do not forget remove page or do deny access";</li>
<q><strong> ^ -> not completed there. so... maybe other things too.</strong></q>
<li>There is special URL for some of src-files, which also ask for credentials;</li>
<q><strong> ^ -> most likely there is can be "access-right"-check.</strong></q>
<li>There is note "do not forget re-change debug admin:admin credentials";</li>
<q><strong> ^ -> if page do not "disabled" - so maybe credentials too. </strong></q>
<li>There is note "do not forget update CMS-framework";</li>
<q><strong> ^ -> looks like that build of this CMS-framework was with known vulnerability;</strong></q>
<li>And some other entry-strings;</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 So after this result with found the hidden-page.
 And as additional potentially points with:
  -> debug credentials (admin:admin);
  which maybe do not changed.
 
  -> URL for page with some of src-files as review-ask other team 
      ( http:/127.0.0.1:8080/formsrc?review=on );
   which also covered by login-form.
   and probably have some of protection-layers;
 
  -> information about CMS Framework 
      (and that there was in use vulnerable build of this CMS);
   with this kind of project:
we will go to think that there is:
  known CMS and 
  known vulnerability for this CMS;
and design of vulnerability is:
  known "backdoor"-access credentials (as administrator-rights account);
Usually known vulnerabilities can be visible under the web:
  any websites, 
  cve-lists, 
  advisories and 
  other.
 
 So maybe this CMS Framework build also still not updated.
  "brief-search" for this vulnerability give the result that backdoor-credentials (CMS:CMSpassword).
</pre>

So, we have some information and able to try do something.

"src"-page covered by login-form (and looks like STRING-check under the parameter query by GET-method);

There is possible some steps: if "registered"-account will try to open this URL; anyone else; admin-account or some of tricks.

So we able to check if CMS Framework not updated and check "backdoor"-credentials from outdated build.

Open from "/hidden" page URL with "src"-files and get login-form.

Type there "CMS"-as-login and "CMSpassword"-as-password;

So we get access denied.... most likely there is check for something (but credentials are valid).

Go back to hidden page (and to src-review page after) or from login-form..

and try to use "admin:admin" for this special-src page.

Page is loaded and we get view of some src-file. Looks like html-template for some of pages.

<pre>
This page should be work as temporary storage for src-files as review-action by other team;

Most likely randomly page do not removed.
But mainly there is have some of "layers" of protection-access
(but not too much proper and valid for this situation);

So based on knowledge of admin-debug-credentials (from forgotten debug-page):
we able to review src of html-template file.
</pre>
<hr />

We can directly study this html-template src-file or will try to login and check what service able to do.

Stay opened src-file page and go open fresh tab with login-form.

And go to use any of already known for us credentials (admin:admin or CMS:CMSpassword).

Most likely there is can be other not strong passwords (by some of music band accounts).

But mainly (with current try) we able to think that music bands will use "strong" passwords.

But also able to think that "design" of handling this passwords can be with some troubles.

<pre>So with direct usage login-form for http://127.0.0.1:8080  and valid credentials</pre>

We able to get form-page like welcome-page.

      http://127.0.0.1:8080/form

There have ability to read information-words and invite listener (as music band's friend or other);

Go do "enter" from first! Ok, we get information that there is required name-field.

So fill it and we able do not fill "phone"-page. 

Or goes try to fill it (or both) with tricks like "html-tags or scripts"

So with this step <code>name</code> can be (as "alert" script usage): 

     <script>alert('name')</script>

And <code>phone</code> can be (as "alert" script usage):

     <script>alert('phone')</script>
     
Fill it and transfer to application.

We get result-page of this action, where information-words and menu with three URLs:

<ul>
<li> Add some else listeners;</li>
<li> Re-login;</li>
<li> And strange named URL</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<pre>
With this step we able back to known page with src-file.
And check it.

We able to get there potential trouble with handling output data from database about phones.

There visible that in somewhat reasons output text for phones comes as "unescaped text".
By the usage Thymeleaf (Java/HTML template engine) features.

Which time to time can be helpful - but not sure - that it can be helpful there.

Looks like that:
</pre>
        
       <td th:utext="${listener.phone}"><code>Listener phone</code></td>
    
<code>th:utext</code> probably comes there randomly (or for temporary debug);

This situation will create potential ability to do <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>

Name field have proper output handling as <code>th:text</code> (escaped text).

So.. with previous fill-action will be situation, when someone able to see list of listeners:

 -> there will be alert from "phone"-field (and visible "string" under the "name"-field).

But this trouble possible to use for any other actions and reasons.

Looks like that page with table of all listeners can be there....

Or just because it asked for review - maybe under the debugging.

-------

So back to the dreams about "strange named URL" under the "thanks-menu" after the transferring listener.

There have strange words as: <q><strong>Do you remember fylkr's song "do The Trick" from album "trick"?</strong></q>

and URL (page which can not be displayed) for 

<pre>http://127.0.0.1:8080/fylkr</pre>

We also able to find that under the "form-thanks" html-page (as src of page) for this URL/menu-tab have next strings:
           
           
      <div sec:authorize = "hasAuthority ('ADMIN')">

Which should means that current point have to visible just for admins... but there is mistake with design.

So this is visible for all.

Most likely that there is can be else one temporary-debug or under-construction page.

And with knowledge that there is mistake and page can be there (and most likely strange words is tips):

 -> we able to start thinking around.

There was already some pages with "string"-checks under the GET-methods.

And looks like there is can be something around it.
We able to re-login under the admin credentials.

But because there is already mistake with check-about - so maybe page will be allowed to all too.

<pre>
We have potential debug-URL with debug-tips.

Words says about fylkr's song (and URL have /fylkr  page-name) song "do The Trick" from album "trick".
Go to think that there is tips how to do GET-query or how should be looks like URL for proper result.

After some tries... we able to get proper configuration for this:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/fylkr?trick=doTheTrick 
</pre>

If we open this URL after previous actions.. so we get firstly alert.

And after that full table (under the HTML template) with all invited listeners.

In fact - page should be visible just for adminstrators.

Looks like that there is just one protection-layer: "parameter"-string from user's browser.

For this type of "hidden" page can be more protection in fact.
