Small background:
-----------------

This is more like "template" (or PoC), than "application" in fact.

    Design based on my too much small experience with all of this "development"-things;

Also I not really friendly with development.

So I decided to do not hard designed application and with some kind of "tricks" (as can be just like template-PoC);

-------

Project available at the github page: https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse

--> and <a href="https://github.com/marrbjorn/documentation/tree/master/F-Secure%20Cyber%20Security%20Base%20MOOC.fi%20-First%20Project">this page</a> will be as documentation of project;


Setup:
======
Get started can be with next steps:
-----------------------------------

<b>FIRST</b>: we have to be able work with https://cybersecuritybase.github.io (which means proper configured IDE and other requirements);

<br />
<strong>SECOND</strong>: download this project ( https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse ) as zip-file or by git-commands as usually.

<br />
<b>THIRD</b>: unpack it (if downloaded zip-file) and open project under the IDE (with Netbeans: "File -> Open Project..." under the menu).
   
    Than do the "Clean and Build Project" (how it called under the Netbeans);
    this will trigger downloading/creating target-files and properly build project;

<br />
<strong>FOURTH</strong>: "Run" application, when required work or required to do some steps with application.

    first launch may ask about main class - choose this default one.
