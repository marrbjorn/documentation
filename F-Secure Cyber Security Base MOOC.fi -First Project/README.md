Small background:
-----------------

This is more like "template" (or PoC), than "application" in fact.

    Design based on my too much small experience with all of this "development"-things;

Also I not really friendly with development.

So I decided to do not hard designed application and with some kind of "tricks" (as can be just like template-PoC);

-------

Project available at the github page: https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse

--> and <a href="https://github.com/marrbjorn/documentation/tree/master/F-Secure%20Cyber%20Security%20Base%20MOOC.fi%20-First%20Project">this page</a> will be as documentation of project;


Setup:
======
Get started can be with next steps:
-----------------------------------

<b>FIRST</b>: we have to be able work with https://cybersecuritybase.github.io (which means proper configured IDE and other requirements);

<br />
<strong>SECOND</strong>: download this project ( https://github.com/marrbjorn/CyberSecurityCourse ) as zip-file or by git-commands as usually.

<br />
<b>THIRD</b>: unpack it (if downloaded zip-file) and open project under the IDE (with Netbeans: "File -> Open Project..." under the menu).
   
    Then do the "Clean and Build Project" (how it called under the Netbeans);
    this will trigger downloading/creating target-files and properly build project;

<br />
<strong>FOURTH</strong>: "Run" application, when required work or required to do some steps with application.

    first launch may ask about main class - choose this default one.

DESIGN OF APPLICATION
=====================
=====================

There is some kind of landing page for music-party/meeting (but mainly friendly service for music bands);

Each music band/musician already registered to be part of this party (by design);

Service <ins>do not</ins> provide ability to add more bands (this is can be covered by the other one steps);

Service <ins>do</ins> provide own access for each music-band/musician to be with ability "invite listeners";

Like "friend" or someone else (some kind of special listeners); 

As result there will be list (database with "name" and "phone-number") of listeners, which invited by music-bands;

Service provide ability to see full list of this listeneres.

    but this is should be available just for adminstrators (of party/service/website);
    
<hr />

There is practically missing any other features or design at work.
And for critical attacks or total impact there is not so many steps.

      but this is do not remove points that:
        -> "vulnerable" things and 
        -> "vulnerable" design of things
      will add vulnerabilities or troubles to application. 
       and this is:
        -> can be "exploited" or 
        -> not (but with potential ability do that).

<strong>This project will be with improve design and additional features later.
But main meanings will be with same design.</strong>
